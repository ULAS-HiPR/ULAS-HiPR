As exam season draws nearer and HiPR activities start to wind down for the semester we want to share some of the progress that we've made on the construction of Sionna.

Jay Looney has been busy cutting the Bluetube which we are using for our bodytube. We've also 3D printed our 5:1 ogival nosecone. This is all possible thanks to the support of the Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Limerick. 

We still have plenty of work left to do so follow us for more updates.
