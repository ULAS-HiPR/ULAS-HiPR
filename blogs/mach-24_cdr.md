Leading up to our CDR submission to Mach-24 last week, we engaged in rigorous testing of various components within our recovery system. While some of our team basked in the sunlight, conducting parachute tests with a dummy cansat, others diligently assessed the battery life of our ground station electronics. Anticipate witnessing further hardware developments as we progress through testing, inching closer to our launch milestone.
