Today we’re going back to the 90’s and highlighting the fascinating work done by our predecessors in LimerickSEDS, the true rocket pioneers in UL. 

Between 1997 and 2000 a group of UL engineering students took it upon themselves to construct and launch a liquid rocket engine. Based on plans for the Systeme Solaire SS67B-1, the pressure bi-liquid engine burnt a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and dry ice pressurised petrol.  

University support funded the project and gave the team access to workshops for construction and static firing took place in the fields behind the University which has since been developed for student accommodation and sports fields. Much of the initial work on the project took place in late 1997 and early 1998 with the team conducting a number of test-fires to validate their ignition system. However, internships put an 8-month hold on the project with work recommencing in 1999. Steady work allowed the team to achieve its first successful hold down test in 2000. 

The first launch attempt took place on May 16th, 2000, in Boora Bog in Co. Offaly. Unfortunately, in-front of a large crowd including members of the media, the rocket failed to ignite. The group was not to be stopped however and with an upgraded ignition sequence, they returned to Boora Bog on September 4th of the same year. This time the ignition was successful and what might be Irelands first liquid rocket engine soared above the bog. However, as anyone who has ever launched a rocket knows a successful recovery can be as elusive as a successful take-off. On this occasion the rocket the rocket landed on one of the only hard spots in the bog and the airframe was destroyed. 

There is much more to this group’s story including an aerospike engine and meeting astronaut Stephen Robinson who has flown four space shuttle missions. As student rocketry continues to grow across the country, we are very proud to be able to showcase this project which seems to have been lost in time.
