Over the Christmas season, work has continued on our rocket, Sionna, as we progress towards our first High-Powered launch early this year. We believe that getting our hands on hardware, trying new ideas and learning what worked and what didn't is the only way to get better. That is why we can't wait to get Sionna onto the launch pad. 

In the attached pictures, you can see various components of the rocket under construction
