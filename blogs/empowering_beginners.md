Over the last 2 months, we've been helping UL Aeronautical Society run a series of rocketry workshops. The purpose of these workshops was to give beginners the opportunity to design and build their own low-powered rockets. For most of the people participating it was their first time scratch building a rocket and the results are impressive. 

We hope to see everyone who attended these workshops at future HiPR meetings. Whether they join or not, it's important to us that we help educate people about rocketry.
